# Twitter Scraper
### A Twitter scraper that doesn't require an API to use.

Will require the following:
- A Twitter account
- Ability to read xlsx files
- Setting up a .env file
<br><br>

## Setting up Global Environments Variables
It will be necessary to create a .env file that contains your Twitter username and password. Place this file in the same location as the twitter_scrapper.py file.
You can, of course, hard code these directly into the program too! 😁
